# Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Medical-Imaging-Analysis-Abnormality-detection-in-mammography

This is the github for the project of the course 'Convolutional Intelligence and Deep Learning',second year of the 'Artifical Intelligence and Data Engineering' master degree.

The aim of the project is use CNNs to execute classification tasks on a modified version of the CBIS DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography).
